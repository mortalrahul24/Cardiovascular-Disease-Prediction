CardioVascular Disease Prediction
A machine learning project designed to predict the likelihood of cardiovascular disease in patients based on medical data. Using various algorithms and data preprocessing techniques, this project analyzes health indicators (like blood pressure, cholesterol levels, age, BMI, etc.) to build a predictive model that can support healthcare providers in identifying at-risk individuals.

Key Features
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Includes steps to handle missing values, normalize data, and feature engineering.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes key patterns and correlations within the dataset to gain insights.
Machine Learning Models: Implements several classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM) to find the best predictive model.
Model Evaluation: Uses metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.
Deployment-Ready: Includes a streamlined pipeline for easy model retraining and potential deployment.
Tech Stack
Languages: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Tools: Jupyter Notebook
Getting Started
Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.
Run the Jupyter notebook for data exploration and model training.
Evaluate and interpret the model results to make data-driven predictions.
Use Case
This project can assist healthcare providers by offering a predictive tool to help in the early detection of cardiovascular diseases, allowing for preventive actions and better patient management.
